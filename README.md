# Maritime AIS Bay Area Visualization and Anomaly Alert System

![AIS Bay Area Screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Project Overview
This project provides a real-time visualization of maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for the San Francisco Bay Area, with a focus on detecting and displaying anomalous vessel behaviors. The system includes:
- A FastAPI backend for ingesting, parsing, and broadcasting AIS messages
- A modern web frontend for map-based vessel visualization and a bottom alert ticker for anomalies
- An anomaly simulation tool for generating synthetic test cases to exercise and test anomaly detection features, including circle spoofing and other vessel movement anomalies
- **Created as an example project to learn [Windsurf IDE](https://windsurf.com/). Not intended for production use without additional testing and code review.**
- _For production use, consider a commercial SaaS alternative such as [myshiptracking.com](https://www.myshiptracking.com/)._

<summary><b>Project Motivation</b> (click to expand)</summary>

This project was inspired by Maritime Pattern Analysis problem sets explored during the National Security Hackathon. It provided a compelling real-world context to learn and experiment with [Windsurf IDE](https://windsurf.com/) and agentic AI coding workflows. By building a maritime AIS visualization and anomaly detection system, the project serves as a practical testbed for evaluating the capabilities of Windsurf IDE.

Additionally, the name "Windsurf" inspired the project's nautical theme. Just as windsurfing involves navigating dynamic waters, this project focuses on navigating, visualizing, and monitoring maritime vessel data‚Äîmaking the nautical setting a natural fit for exploring Windsurf IDE's capabilities.

**Special thanks to [Cerebral Valley](https://cerebralvalley.ai/), [Shield Capital](https://shieldcap.com/), and [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/) (for providing a Pro subscription credit during the hackathon) for organizing, supporting, and inspiring this work!**

## Live AIS Data via aisstream.io
This project uses [aisstream.io](https://aisstream.io/) to receive live AIS vessel data. The backend connects to the aisstream.io WebSocket API to ingest real-time messages for vessels operating in the San Francisco Bay Area.

<details>
<summary><b>Subscription Logic</b> (click to expand)</summary>

- **Geographic Limiting:**
  - The subscription request includes a bounding box that restricts data to the Bay Area, reducing bandwidth and focusing analysis on relevant vessels.
- **Message Types:**
  - The subscription requests a comprehensive set of AIS message types, including `PositionReport`, `StandardClassBPositionReport`, `StaticDataReport`, `ShipStaticData`, `AidsToNavigationReport`, `BaseStationReport`, and others. This ensures the system receives both dynamic (position, speed, heading) and static (name, type, destination) vessel information, as well as navigation aids and base station updates.
- **Example Subscription Payload:**
```json
{
  "APIKey": "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
  "BoundingBoxes": [[minLat, minLon, maxLat, maxLon]],
  "FilterMessageTypes": [
    "PositionReport", "StandardClassBPositionReport", "StaticDataReport", "ShipStaticData", "AidsToNavigationReport", "BaseStationReport", ...
  ]
}
```

<summary><b>MMSI to Flag (Country) Parsing</b> (click to expand)</summary>

The first 3 digits of an MMSI (Maritime Mobile Service Identity) represent the vessel's Maritime Identification Digits (MID), which indicate the country of registration. The backend parses the flag by looking up this MID.

| MMSI Prefix (MID) | Country          | Example Flag Emoji |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| 316               | Canada           | üá®üá¶               |
| 366, 367, 368, 369| United States    | üá∫üá∏               |
| 232, 233, 234, 235| United Kingdom   | üá¨üáß               |
| 538               | Marshall Islands | üá≤üá≠               |
| 636               | Liberia          | üá±üá∑               |
| 248               | Malta            | üá≤üáπ               |
| 563               | Singapore        | üá∏üá¨               |
| ...               | ...              | ...                |

The system uses a lookup table (see `countryToFlagEmoji` in the code) to convert the MMSI prefix to a country name and emoji. If the prefix is not recognized, it defaults to 'Unknown' (üè≥Ô∏è).

</details>

## Anomaly Detection Features

<details>
<summary><b>Anomaly Simulator</b> (click to expand)</summary>

The anomaly simulator (`anomaly_simulation.py`) is designed to:
- Inject synthetic AIS anomalies (teleportation, speed jumps, course changes, identity swaps, dark periods, and circle spoofing) via backend endpoints
- Exercise the alert ticker and backend detection logic for robust system testing
- Provide a repeatable way to validate alerting and visualization features
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>About Circle Spoofing</b> (click to expand)</summary>

Circle spoofing is a maritime AIS anomaly in which a vessel appears to move in an unnaturally perfect circular path. This pattern is often the result of deliberate manipulation of AIS signals and can be used to mask a vessel's true movements or intent. The backend includes logic to detect this behavior and generate alerts. For more information, see this reference: [AIS Spoofing Explained by Pole Star Global](https://www.polestarglobal.com/resources/ais-spoofing/)
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Backend Data Structure</b> (click to expand)</summary>

- **vessels**: Latest state for each MMSI (position, speed, heading, etc.)
- **vessel_history**: List of all received reports per MMSI
- **vessel_profiles**: Rolling statistics for speed/heading per vessel
- **spatial_index**: Geospatial lookup for vessels
- **ais_message_queue**: Async queue for processing both live and injected AIS messages
