<summary><b>Anomaly Types</b> (click to expand)</summary>

| Anomaly Type | Description | Detection Method |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| Teleportation | Vessel position jumps impossibly far in a short time | Distance/time threshold |
| Circle Spoofing | Vessel moves in an unnaturally perfect circular path | Circular pattern detection |
| Speed Anomaly | Vessel speed changes dramatically or exceeds physical limits | Statistical deviation from typical speeds |
| Dark Period | Vessel stops transmitting for suspicious duration | Time since last update |
| Identity Swap | Vessel appears to change identity | MMSI inconsistency detection |

</details># Maritime AIS Visualization & Anomaly Detection
## A Learning Project with Windsurf IDE

![AIS Bay Area Screenshot](screenshot.png)

## üìö Project Context & Acknowledgments

This project was developed as an educational exercise during the National Security Hackathon, with generous support from:
- [Cerebral Valley](https://cerebralvalley.ai/) for organizing the hackathon
- [Shield Capital](https://shieldcap.com/) for their mentorship and support
- [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/) for providing Pro subscription access during the event

The system attempts to visualize maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for the San Francisco Bay Area, with a focus on exploring anomaly detection techniques. This represents an educational prototype rather than a production-ready system.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note:** This project is provided for educational purposes only and is not intended for production use. For production maritime tracking needs, consider commercial SaaS alternatives such as [myshiptracking.com](https://www.myshiptracking.com/).

**Built upon the work of:**
- [aisstream.io](https://aisstream.io/) for providing the AIS data API
- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) and [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) for mapping capabilities
- Numerous open-source AIS data processing techniques and research

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Implementation 

The prototype system consists of:

### System Components
- A FastAPI backend that processes AIS messages
- A web frontend that displays vessel positions on an interactive map
- An anomaly simulation tool for testing detection capabilities

### Technical Approach
- **Data Acquisition**: Integration with aisstream.io's WebSocket API
- **Processing Pipeline**: Backend parsing of AIS message types into structured data
- **Visualization**: Map-based representation of vessel positions and movements
- **Anomaly Detection**: Basic algorithms to identify potentially unusual vessel behavior

This work represents an early exploration rather than a comprehensive solution, with many opportunities for improvement in data processing, anomaly detection sophistication, and system architecture.

## üß† Windsurf IDE: Development Environment

The project provided an opportunity to explore [Windsurf IDE](https://windsurf.com/)'s capabilities for software development:

### Learning Aspects
- Exploring collaboration between developer and AI assistant
- Testing real-time feedback loops during development
- Attempting to integrate domain knowledge with technical implementation

### Educational Value
- Understanding the potential and limitations of AI assistance in coding
- Learning to articulate development requirements clearly
- Gaining experience with WebSocket communication patterns
- Practicing geospatial data visualization techniques

This project does not represent the full capabilities of Windsurf IDE, but rather our initial exploration as beginners with the platform.

## üîÆ Lessons Learned & Future Work

### What We Learned
- Practical challenges in handling live maritime data streams
- Basic approaches to anomaly detection in movement patterns
- Development workflow considerations when using AI assistance

### Future Improvements
Building on this initial prototype, future work might include:
- **Improved Data Security**: Secure storage for API credentials
- **Additional Data Sources**: Integration with supplementary maritime information
- **Code Quality**: Comprehensive testing and refactoring
- **Enhanced Architecture**: Restructuring for maintainability
- **Standards Compliance**: Integration with established AIS parser libraries

### Quick Demo Guide
For demonstration purposes:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn ais_websocket_server:app --reload
# Open http://localhost:8000/static/ais_map.html
```
