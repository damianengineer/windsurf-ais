[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Watch the demo video](./demo720.mov)

## Project Overview

This educational project provides a visualization of maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for the San Francisco Bay Area, focusing on detecting and displaying anomalous vessel behaviors. The system includes:

- A FastAPI backend for processing and broadcasting AIS messages
- A web frontend for map-based vessel visualization with an alert ticker
- An anomaly simulation tool for generating test cases

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note:** This project is intended for educational purposes only and not for production use without additional testing and code review. For production maritime tracking needs, consider commercial alternatives such as [myshiptracking.com](https://www.myshiptracking.com/).

<details>
<summary><b>Project Motivation</b> (click to expand)</summary>

This project was inspired by Maritime Pattern Analysis problem sets explored during the National Security Hackathon. It provided an opportunity to learn and experiment with [Windsurf IDE](https://windsurf.com/) and agentic AI coding workflows through a practical maritime application.

**Special thanks to [Cerebral Valley](https://cerebralvalley.ai/), [Shield Capital](https://shieldcap.com/), and [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/) for organizing, supporting, and inspiring this work!**

## Installation & Setup

<details>
<summary><b>Prerequisites</b> (click to expand)</summary>

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js (for advanced frontend development, optional)
- [Windsurf IDE](https://windsurf.com/) (recommended for AI-assisted development)
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Quick Start</b> (click to expand)</summary>

```sh
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the backend server
uvicorn ais_websocket_server:app --reload

# View the application
# Open http://localhost:8000/static/ais_map.html in your browser
```

To test anomaly detection:
```sh
python anomaly_simulation.py
```
</details>

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>Troubleshooting</b> (click to expand)</summary>

**Purging Data When Launching Backend:**
- To clear all vessel and anomaly state for a fresh test, use the backend's `/reset_data` endpoint. You can do this with curl:
  ```sh
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/reset_data
  ```
  This will clear all in-memory vessel state, history, and spatial index. It is useful if you want to start with a clean slate or encounter stale/duplicate vessel data.

**Other Troubleshooting Tips:**
- If the map or chat assistant is not updating, ensure the backend is running and accessible at the expected port (default: 8000).
- If you encounter CORS or WebSocket connection issues, make sure your browser and backend are both using the correct hostname and port.
- To force reload vessel data, refresh the browser after resetting the backend data.
- For persistent issues, check backend logs for errors or stack traces.
- If the chat assistant cannot connect, ensure the chat server is running on port 5001 and that your `.env` file contains a valid OpenAI API key.

## Data Sources & Processing

### Live AIS Data via aisstream.io

This project uses [aisstream.io](https://aisstream.io/) to receive live AIS vessel data for the San Francisco Bay Area.

<details>
<summary><b>Getting Your Own API Key</b> (click to expand)</summary>

To run the project with live AIS data:
1. Register for a free account at [aisstream.io](https://aisstream.io/)
2. Navigate to your account dashboard and generate an API key
3. Copy your API key into a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   AISSTREAM_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
   ```
4. Restart the backend server to begin streaming live data
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Subscription Logic</b> (click to expand)</summary>

The subscription request includes a geographic bounding box for the Bay Area and requests comprehensive AIS message types including position reports, static data, and aids to navigation.

Example subscription payload:
```json
{
  "APIKey": "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
  "BoundingBoxes": [[minLat, minLon, maxLat, maxLon]],
  "FilterMessageTypes": [
    "PositionReport", "StandardClassBPositionReport", "StaticDataReport", 
    "ShipStaticData", "AidsToNavigationReport", "BaseStationReport"
  ]
}
```

<details>
<summary><b>MMSI to Flag (Country) Parsing</b> (click to expand)</summary>

The first 3 digits of an MMSI (Maritime Mobile Service Identity) represent the vessel's Maritime Identification Digits (MID), which indicate the country of registration. Example MIDs:

| MMSI Prefix | Country          | Flag Emoji |
|-------------|------------------|------------|
| 366-369     | United States    | üá∫üá∏        |

| 636         | Liberia          | üá±üá∑        |

The system uses a lookup table to convert MMSI prefixes to country names and emoji flags.

## Anomaly Detection System

The project includes a basic system for detecting unusual vessel behavior patterns:

<details>
<summary><b>Anomaly Types</b> (click to expand)</summary>

| Anomaly Type | Description | Detection Method |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| Teleportation | Vessel position jumps impossibly far in a short time | Distance/time threshold |
| Circle Spoofing | Vessel moves in an unnaturally perfect circular path | Circular pattern detection |
| Speed Anomaly | Vessel speed changes dramatically or exceeds physical limits | Statistical deviation from typical speeds |
| Dark Period | Vessel stops transmitting for suspicious duration | Time since last update |
| Identity Swap | Vessel appears to change identity | MMSI inconsistency detection |
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Anomaly Simulator</b> (click to expand)</summary>

The anomaly simulator (`anomaly_simulation.py`) is designed to:
- Inject synthetic AIS anomalies via backend endpoints
- Exercise the alert ticker and detection logic
- Provide a repeatable way to test detection features
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>About Circle Spoofing</b> (click to expand)</summary>

Circle spoofing is a maritime AIS anomaly in which a vessel appears to move in an unnaturally perfect circular path, often the result of deliberate manipulation to mask a vessel's true movements. For more information, see [AIS Spoofing Explained by Pole Star Global](https://www.polestarglobal.com/resources/ais-spoofing/)

## LLM-Enabled Chat Server

This project includes an LLM-enabled chat server to provide interactive vessel and map chat capabilities using OpenAI or compatible APIs. This server is separate from the main AIS backend and must be started independently.

### Starting the Chat Server

```
uvicorn chat_enabled_server:app --reload --port 5001
```

- The chat server will be available at http://localhost:5001
- Ensure your `.env` file contains a valid OpenAI API key (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here`)
- The frontend will connect to this server for chat assistant features

## Known Issues & Future Work

- Visualize first and second order time derivatives (velocity, acceleration) for vessel movement to enable richer analytics.
- Incorporate additional normalized data sources (e.g., geospatial imaging) for cross-correlation and advanced enrichment.
- Integrate more robust error handling, logging, and testing for reliability.
- Support improved vessel type filtering, area-based spoofing/anomaly scenarios, and collaborative map annotation.
- Enhance UI/UX for alert visualization, vessel details, and user interaction (including chat).
- Enable advanced anomaly and threat detection based on use cases supported by enriched and multi-modal data sets.
