# Maritime AIS Bay Area Visualization and Anomaly Alert System

![AIS Bay Area Screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Project Overview
This project provides a real-time visualization of maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for the San Francisco Bay Area, with a focus on detecting and displaying anomalous vessel behaviors. The system includes:
- A FastAPI backend for ingesting, parsing, and broadcasting AIS messages.
- A modern web frontend for map-based vessel visualization and a bottom alert ticker for anomalies.
- An anomaly simulation tool for generating synthetic test cases (e.g., with Star Trek vessel names) as a starting point for exercising and testing anomaly detection features.
- **Created as an example project to learn Windsurf IDE. Not intended for production use without additional testing and code review.**

## Project Motivation
This project was inspired by Maritime Pattern Analysis problem sets explored during the National Security Hackathon. It provided a compelling real-world context to learn and experiment with Windsurf IDE and agentic AI coding workflows. By building a maritime AIS visualization and anomaly detection system, the project serves as a practical testbed for evaluating the capabilities of Windsurf IDE.

Additionally, the name "Windsurf" itself inspired the project's nautical theme. Just as windsurfing involves navigating dynamic waters, this project focuses on navigating, visualizing, and monitoring maritime vessel data‚Äîmaking the nautical setting a natural fit for exploring Windsurf IDE's capabilities.

## MMSI to Flag (Country) Parsing
The first 3 digits of an MMSI (Maritime Mobile Service Identity) represent the vessel's Maritime Identification Digits (MID), which indicate the country of registration. The backend parses the flag by looking up this MID.

| MMSI Prefix (MID) | Country          | Example Flag Emoji |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| 316               | Canada           | üá®üá¶               |
| 366, 367, 368, 369| United States    | üá∫üá∏               |
| 232, 233, 234, 235| United Kingdom   | üá¨üáß               |
| 538               | Marshall Islands | üá≤üá≠               |
| 636               | Liberia          | üá±üá∑               |
| 248               | Malta            | üá≤üáπ               |
| 563               | Singapore        | üá∏üá¨               |
| ...               | ...              | ...                |

The system uses a lookup table (see `countryToFlagEmoji` in the code) to convert the MMSI prefix to a country name and emoji. If the prefix is not recognized, it defaults to 'Unknown' (üè≥Ô∏è).

## Unique Capabilities of Windsurf IDE (with GPT-4.1)
Windsurf IDE stands out from other AI coding environments and assistants due to:
- **Agentic Coding:** Windsurf enables AI agents to perform multi-step, autonomous coding actions, such as searching, editing, running, and debugging code, not just generating code snippets.
- **Full-Stack Context:** The AI has access to your entire project, including backend, frontend, and configuration files, allowing for holistic understanding and changes.
- **Live Code Execution:** You can run servers, scripts, and tests directly in the IDE, with AI able to observe outputs and iterate based on real results.
- **Persistent Memory:** The AI remembers project context, design decisions, and user preferences across sessions, enabling more personalized and effective assistance.
- **Seamless Collaboration:** Human users and AI agents can work together in real-time, making it easy to prototype, debug, and document complex systems.
- **Rich UI Integration:** Features like browser previews, file explorers, and terminal access are tightly integrated, making development and troubleshooting more interactive and visual.

Compared to other AI assistants, Windsurf IDE is more autonomous, context-aware, and collaborative, making it ideal for rapid prototyping and learning.

## Using Windsurf IDE
Windsurf IDE enables:
- Real-time code editing, debugging, and visualization of backend/frontend changes.
- Seamless collaboration with AI for implementing features, troubleshooting, and understanding code structure.
- Running and visualizing the project locally, including live map updates and anomaly alert ticker.

**Workflow Example:**
1. Open the project in Windsurf IDE.
2. Inspect, modify, and run backend or frontend code directly in the IDE.
3. Visualize live vessel data and anomaly alerts in the browser.
4. Use the anomaly simulator to generate test cases and observe system response.

## Installation & Running the App

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js (for advanced frontend development, optional)
- [Windsurf IDE](https://windsurf.codeium.com/) (recommended for full AI/IDE experience)

### Install Python Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Backend
```sh
uvicorn ais_websocket_server:app --reload
```

### Running the Frontend
- Open your browser to: `http://localhost:8000/static/ais_map.html`
- Do **not** open the HTML file directly; always use the local server.

### Simulating Anomalies
```sh
python anomaly_simulation.py
```
This will inject various vessel anomalies for alert testing.

---

## Anomaly Simulator
The anomaly simulator (`anomaly_simulation.py`) is designed to:
- Inject synthetic AIS anomalies (teleportation, speed jumps, course changes, identity swaps, dark periods) via backend endpoints.
- Exercise the alert ticker and backend detection logic for robust system testing.
- Provide a repeatable way to validate alerting and visualization features.

---

## Backend Data Structure
- **vessels**: Latest state for each MMSI (position, speed, heading, etc.)
- **vessel_history**: List of all received reports per MMSI
- **vessel_profiles**: Rolling statistics for speed/heading per vessel
- **spatial_index**: Geospatial lookup for vessels
- **ais_message_queue**: Async queue for processing both live and injected AIS messages
